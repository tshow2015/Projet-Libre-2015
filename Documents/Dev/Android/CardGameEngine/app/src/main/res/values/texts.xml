a.	Drawing a card from the deck
b.	Playing a card
The card chosen by the player needs to be:
i.	Of the same suit of the card on the Playing Pile
ii.   Of the same value of the card on the Playing Pile
iii.  A Special Card such as a: 2, 8, or  Joker
4-	The first player to empty its hand WINS!

Djambo is a very simple but tricky game.
The winner of the game is decided at the very last turn!
-At the beginning of the game every player is given the same number of cards and a “first player” is randomly chosen and given the “initiative” to draw a card.
-The following players will then play a card of the same suit if they possess one and any card if they do not.
-The next player to get the “initiative” is the one who has played the card with the highest value (of the same suit as the one played by the “initiative” player).
-To put in perspective the importance of the “initiative”, one needs to realize that having the initiative at the last turn AND a very high value card is nearly a sure-win.
